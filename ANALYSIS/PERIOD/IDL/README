The set of programs periodogram.pro,globalinclude.f,globalwrapper.c replace
the functionality of the analyzer.f program. To begin,check the file
globalinclude.f to make sure that the parameters are correct. The relevant
parameters are PISYM and JMIN. PISYM determines whether or not the model is pi
symmetric and JMIN is the minimum radius at which the amplitudes are
calculated. Next, make the sharable objects by typing "make" at the command
line. The makefile uses the gcc and portland group compilers. You can change
these if you don't have one or the other, be aware that the necessary flags
will probably change. After making the objects, edit the file
periodogram.pro. Most of the values that need to be changed are in the top
section. Set JMAX, KMAX, and LMAX as well as STEPBEGIN, STEPEND and
STEPSKIP. JREQ and AUJREQ are used to set the radius scale for real
units. JTOP is the radius out to which amplitudes are calculated. MINDT should
be about 10 times the delt of a single step. TORP is the number of PTUs in a
ORP. DR is Rof3N. If RHOSWITCH is set to 1 the program will use rho files to
construct the amplitudes, otherwise will use the COEFFILE that you specify.
